> Based on [astronomyk/seestarpy](https://github.com/astronomyk/seestarpy).

### Image streaming (firmware 7.75+)

- **`stream.get_live_image`** — Sends ``begin_streaming`` / ``stop_streaming``
  on the image socket by default.  Required on current firmware to avoid
  connection resets when grabbing preview frames.
- **`stream.decode_payload`** — Accepts ZIP-compressed 16-bit Bayer previews
  (S30-family devices) in addition to ZIP-compressed RGB stacked frames.

### S30 wide camera

- **`seestarpy.wide`** — Helpers for dual-camera S30 / S30 Pro devices:
  enable/switch wide camera, read ``SecondView`` app state, scenery and
  star-mode preparation.
- **`stream.capture_rtsp_frame`** / **`stream.get_wide_live_image`** —
  One-shot wide capture via RTSP (scenery) or port 4804 (star).
- **`raw.set_stack_type`** — JSON-RPC wrapper used by seestar_alp
  (``DeepSky``, ``SolarSystem``, ``MilkyWay``).

### Preview post-processing

- **`seestarpy.postprocess`** — Optional Bayer demosaic before stretch/save.
  Pass ``postprocess="debayer"`` to :func:`stream.save_image` /
  :func:`stream.get_live_image` (requires OpenCV).

### Tooling

- **GitHub Actions** — Unit-test workflow (``pytest --ignore=tests/integration``).
- **GitHub Pages** — Sphinx docs built and published on every push to
  ``master`` (https://grapeot.github.io/seestarpy-s30/).

## v0.5.0 — 2026-06-16

> **Compatibility:** this release targets the **Seestar app v3.2.0 /
> firmware v7.75** generation. The onboard batch-stacking workflow
> (`stack`, `crowdsky`) now sends sub-frame paths in the form v7.75
> requires; on earlier firmware that path format is not guaranteed to work.
> **If your Seestar runs firmware earlier than v7.75 (app < v3.2.0), pin a
> previous seestarpy release** (e.g. `pip install "seestarpy<0.5"`).
> Firmware 7.18+ authentication (a signing key) is still required.

### Connection / session layer

- **`connection.multiple_ips`** — No longer mutates the shared module
  global ``DEFAULT_IP`` to retarget calls. Concurrent broadcasts to
  multiple Seestars previously raced on that global, so a command could be
  sent to the wrong scope. Each worker now sets a per-thread active IP
  (``connection.current_ip()``), and nested decorated calls inherit the
  outer scope instead of snapping back to ``DEFAULT_IP``.
- **`connection.send_command`** — Reuses one persistent, authenticated TCP
  connection per Seestar (``_Connection`` pool) instead of opening a fresh
  socket and re-running the firmware 7.18+ RSA handshake on every call. A
  long polling loop (e.g. `stack_blocks`) now authenticates once rather
  than once per poll. Drops are detected and the next call reconnects,
  re-authenticates and retries once; ``close_connections()`` (also run at
  interpreter exit) tears the pool down. Toggle with
  ``connection.PERSIST_CONNECTIONS``. Note: on an unrecoverable failure it
  now raises ``ConnectionError`` instead of returning an empty string.
- **`data._connect_smb` / `data._build_http_url` / `crowdsky._read_fits_ra_dec`**
  — Resolve the target host via ``connection.current_ip()`` so multi-IP
  broadcasts address the right Seestar.
- **`auth`** — Clearer ``AuthenticationError`` message: a rejected
  ``verify_client`` now means the signature didn't match this firmware
  (re-extract the key), not the previously-implied "code=None" case that
  the id-matching handshake fix already eliminated.

### Bug fixes — CrowdSky output rename

- **`crowdsky._rename_output`** — No longer fails silently. The
  idempotency-critical ``.fit`` rename is attempted first and treated as
  fatal on failure (returns ``None`` and warns that the block is *not*
  covered and will be re-stacked), while ``.jpg`` / ``_thn.jpg`` companions
  are now best-effort: a missing companion no longer aborts the whole
  rename and undoes a good ``.fit`` rename. SMB-connect failures and the
  ``HP000000`` HEALPix placeholder (from an unreadable RA/Dec header) now
  emit explicit warnings. `stack_blocks` records a ``rename_failed`` flag in
  each completed block's result.
- **`crowdsky._read_fits_ra_dec`** — Reads 8 FITS header blocks (23040 B)
  instead of 2, so RA/Dec parsing is robust to larger headers.

### Bug fixes — firmware v7.75 onboard stacking

- **`stack.set_batch_stack_setting`** — Firmware v7.75 no longer resolves
  bare sub-frame filenames; it requires each ``files`` entry's ``name`` to
  be a **full relative path from the SD-card root** (e.g.
  ``"MyWorks/NGC 7000_sub/Light_....fit"``). Bare names made the firmware
  fail instantly with ``state="fail"``, ``error="no image"``, ``code=267``.
  Bare filenames are now prefixed with ``path`` automatically; entries that
  already contain a ``/`` are sent unchanged, so callers don't have to
  change. The JSON-RPC method name and ``params`` shape are unchanged from
  v3.0.2 — only the file-name resolution changed. Confirmed live on a
  Seestar S30 Pro (firmware 7.75) on 2026-06-15.
- **`stack.clear_batch_stack`** — Now calls the firmware's direct
  ``clear_batch_stack`` JSON-RPC method (present and returning ``code=0``
  on v7.75), falling back to the legacy ``clear_app_state`` /
  ``{"name": "BatchStack"}`` approach if the firmware returns ``code=103``.
- **`auth` handshake** — The challenge/response reader now matches replies
  by JSON-RPC ``id`` and skips interleaved unsolicited events
  (``PiStatus``, ``temp``, …). Previously the first ``\r\n`` frame after a
  command was assumed to be its reply, so events streamed during an active
  batch stack were occasionally parsed as the ``verify_client`` reply,
  causing intermittent ``AuthenticationError (code=None)`` failures while
  polling stack progress.
- **`crowdsky.stack_blocks` / `stack_all`** — Hardened the per-block loop:
  clears stale ``BatchStack`` state before configuring, checks the
  ``start_batch_stack`` response code, surfaces the firmware error string
  on failure, handles unexpected states, and adds a ``max_wait_sec``
  (default 3600 s) timeout so a wedged block can no longer hang the run.

## v0.4.2 — 2026-05-04

### Bug fixes / behaviour

- **`crowdsky._request`** — Reverted the shared timeout default to a
  flat 30 s. The 0.4.1 change had pushed the long `(30, 300)` tuple
  into every call site, including small reads like `list_stacks()`
  and `raw_start_session()`, which would now hang for up to 5 minutes
  on a stuck server before failing.
- **`crowdsky.upload_stack`** — Now overrides the timeout locally with
  `(30, 300)`, so the long read window only applies to the actual
  ~12 MB FITS upload that needs it. Other crowdsky calls fail fast
  again on hangs.

## v0.4.1 — 2026-05-02

### Bug fixes

- **`crowdsky` uploads** — A flat 30 s HTTP timeout was insufficient
  for ~12 MB stack uploads over slow or long-haul uplinks (e.g. AU
  residential to crowdsky.univie.ac.at). The internal `_request`
  helper now passes `requests` a `(connect, read)` timeout tuple of
  `(30, 300)`, keeping a fast connect bound while giving big uploads
  room to complete.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-05-02

### New features

- **`stream.show_current_stack()`** — Low-friction one-shot matplotlib
  viewer. Grabs the latest stacked frame and pops up an auto-stretched
  window in a single line:

  ```python
  from seestarpy import stream
  stream.show_current_stack()
  ```

  With `ips="all"` (or `ips=[1, 2]`) frames are fetched in parallel
  from all selected Seestars and tiled into a subplot grid on a single
  figure. Returns `(header, arr8)` for one scope or
  `{ip: (header, arr8)}` for many.

- **`connection.resolve_ips()`** — IP-resolution logic factored out of
  the `@multiple_ips` decorator into a public helper, so other code
  paths (like `show_current_stack`) can share the same `ips=`
  semantics without going through the decorator.

### Packaging

- **`cryptography` is now a standard dependency.** Firmware 7.18+
  authentication is the common case rather than the exception, so the
  separate `seestarpy[auth]` install variant has been removed. A plain
  `pip install seestarpy` now ships everything you need to authenticate
  against modern firmware. The openssl CLI fallback in `auth` stays as
  a runtime safety net.

### Behaviour changes

- **`stream.get_live_image()`** — Default `read_timeout` raised from
  8.0 s to 30.0 s to comfortably cover the 8MP S30 Pro frames over
  Wi-Fi.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-04-27

### Bug fixes

- **`stream.get_live_image()`** — skip past zero-dimension ack/keepalive
  frames the Seestar sends in response to image requests. Previously a
  one-shot grab would frequently return an empty header, causing
  `decode_payload` / `save_image` to raise
  `ValueError: Zero-dimension frame (ack/keepalive)` even when the
  scope was actively stacking. The function now loops on the socket up
  to `max_ack_frames` (default 10) until a frame with real dimensions
  arrives.

### New parameters on `get_live_image()`

- `max_ack_frames` (default 10) — bound the ack-skipping loop.
- `fallback` (default True) — if `get_stacked_img` yields no real
  frames (e.g. the scope just woke and stacking hasn't started), retry
  once on the same socket with `get_current_img` so callers always get
  *something* renderable when available.
- `read_timeout` (default 8.0 s) — bound per-recv waits so a silent
  Seestar can't strand a caller indefinitely.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-02

### New modules

- **`stream.py`** — Live image streaming from the Seestar's binary socket
  protocol (ports 4800/4804). Supports one-shot grabs (`get_live_image`),
  continuous streaming with callbacks (`start_stream`), and a live
  matplotlib display window. Handles both ZIP-compressed stacked frames
  and raw Bayer preview frames. Includes auto-stretch for faint
  nebulosity and FITS/PNG/JPEG export.

- **`plan.py`** — Observation plan commands reverse-engineered from the
  official Seestar app v3.0.2. Send plans (`set_view_plan`), stop them
  (`stop_view_plan`), and query status (`get_running_plan`). All payloads
  confirmed via live traffic capture.

- **`stack.py`** — Batch stacking commands (`set_batch_stack_setting`,
  `start_batch_stack`, `stop_batch_stack`, polling via `iscope_get_app_state`).

- **`crowdsky.py`** — CrowdSky time-block stacking with WebDAV upload
  support.

### New features

- **`create_mosaic_plan()`** — Generate multi-panel observation plans that
  tile a rectangular sky region. Boustrophedon (snake) traversal minimises
  slew distance. Handles cos(dec) correction for RA spacing.

- **`plot_mosaic_plan()`** — Visualise mosaic panel layouts on a zoomed
  Mollweide projection with RA/Dec grid lines. Auto-zooms to 150% of the
  panel footprint area.

- **`set_default_ip(n)`** — Quick helper to switch `DEFAULT_IP` between
  multiple Seestars by number (e.g. `set_default_ip(2)` for
  `seestar-2.local`).

- **`@multiple_ips` decorator** — Moved to `connection.py` and applied to
  `ui`, `status`, `stack`, `crowdsky`, and `data` modules. Pass `ips=` to
  broadcast commands to multiple Seestars in parallel.

- **`data.py` refactored** — Now uses `get_albums` under the hood.
  Added filetype filter to `list_folder_contents` and graceful handling of
  missing folders. Multi-IP support via `@multiple_ips`.

- **`build_rtsp_url()`** — Helper to construct RTSP URLs for the Seestar's
  live H.264 video feeds (ports 4554/4555).

### Bug fixes

- **Stream display flicker** — The matplotlib live display now stays on
  the stacked frame once received, instead of alternating between
  stacked and preview frames on each heartbeat cycle.

- **Event listener shutdown** — Graceful shutdown replacing the
  `AttributeError` crash workaround.

- **`raw.set_settings`** — Updated to work with firmware v6.7.

### Documentation

- All docstrings updated to NumPy-style Sphinx/RTD format across the
  entire package.
- New Sphinx API pages for `plan`, `stack`, and `stream` modules.
- New tutorials: observation plans, live streaming.
- Protocol reference: image stream binary format documented in
  `docs/info/image_stream_protocol.rst`.

### Housekeeping

- Removed unused `stacking`, `old_code`, and `rtsp_client` modules.
- Moved `mobile_app` to separate `seestarpy-utils` repository.
- Removed `build` and `twine` from runtime dependencies (they were
  incorrectly listed as dependencies instead of dev tools).
- Added `click` to dependencies (required by CLI entry point).
- Added integration test framework (94 tests against live Seestar).
- Added `CLAUDE.md` for AI assistant onboarding.
